<!-- Update the below to include the lands on which the workshop is being presented if it is an in-person event. -->
## Acknowledgement of country
We wish to acknowledge the custodians of the land we reside on. These lessons were developed on the lands of the Wadjuk (Perth region) people of the Nyoongar nation. We pay our respect to their Elders and acknowledge their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of our cities and regions.


## Overview
This training was developed by [ADACS](https://adacs.org.au) in collaboration with the ASA ECR chapter.

This workshop has been developed in the style of Carpentries (hence the site layout) but is not an official Carpentries lesson.
Some of the content is intended for learners to read, think, and ask questions.
The workshop is designed to have three lessons per day dedicated to explaining and demonstrating skills, followed by an afternoon session of skills practice where people can work on their group project.

### Workshop Format

This workshop is deisnged to be consumed in two modes. The primary mode being an online collaborative facilitated event, for interactive learning, and the secondary mode as a self-paced activity.
Each of the four workshops are designed to fit into a 2 hour timeslot, with 90 mins of content and 30 mins of additional time to allow for extended questions and discussion, but also in case of technical difficulties.
There are four workshops in total, and they will be presented as an "on" session, where we follow through the workshop content, and an "off" week where there is no aditional content, with the aim of giving participants time to digest and try out many of the lessons that they have learned, and then have a follow up discussion about troubles they have found or further ideas that they had.

## Assumed knowledge / required software
This course assumes that you have basic proficiency in python.


Software requirements for running on your own computer:
- Python 3.8+ with the following modules ([requirements.txt]({{page.root}}{% link data/requirements.txt%}))
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - <others>
- make
  - [Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
  - OSX `brew install make`
  - Linux `sudo apt install build-essential` (though likely already installed)
- Nextflow ([installation instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation))
- An integrated development environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) or text editor of choice
  - We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


If the above doesn't work for you or you would like to work on a cloud system then we recommend that you use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/), it is free and requires only a Google account to access.

## Engagement
This workshop is all about learning by doing.
We will be engaging in live coding type exercises for most of the workshop, and we will set challenges and exercises for you to complete in groups.
The more you engage with your fellow learners and the more questions that you ask, the more that you will get out of this workshop.

We will be using sticky notes for in-person participants to indicate their readiness to move on: please stick them on your laptop screen to indicate if you need help or are done and ready to move ahead.
For those joining online we'll be using emotes to indicate the same.

We will use a shared document ([etherpad]({{site.ether_pad}})) to manage and record many of our interactions.


## Conduct

This workshop will be an inclusive and equitable space, which respects:
- the lived experience of it's attendees,
- the right for all to learn, and
- the fact that learning means making mistakes.

We ask that you follow these guidelines:

- Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
- Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate.
- Be considerate and respectful to others.
- Do not insult or put down other attendees.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals.
- Do not engage in tech-shaming.
